Hello!

Before starting the task we need you to do some quick setup steps.

(Don't worry, time spent on these steps will not count towards your time)

1. Run python /home/agent/.agent_code/human_setup.py
2. Read the printed instructions
3. Start the clock with the `clock!` command

NOTE: If using multiple terminal windows, try to remember to run `setup!` after opening a new window. (This lets us record terminal commands in the new window)
