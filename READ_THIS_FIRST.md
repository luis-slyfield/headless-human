Hello!

Before starting the task we need you to do some quick setup steps.

(Don't worry, time spent on these steps will not count towards your time)

1. Read the notes below
2. Run `python /home/agent/.agent_code/human_setup.py`
3. Read the printed instructions
4. Start the clock with the `clock!` command and begin the task.

NOTES:

- If using multiple terminal windows, try to remember to run `setup!` after opening a new window. (This lets us record terminal commands in the new window). 
  - If you forget, don't worry. Just run `python /home/agent/.agent_code/human_setup.py` or `setup!` if you remember.
- Please don't modify any files in the `~/.agent_code/` directory. Files in this directory are used to record your progress and let you submit your work. They are not useful to the task itself.
